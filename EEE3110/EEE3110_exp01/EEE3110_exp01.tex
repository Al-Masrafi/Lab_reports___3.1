\section{Introduction to MATLAB}
\subsection{Theory and MATLAB Code}


MATLAB, short for \textbf{Matrix Laboratory}, is a powerful and versatile tool used for mathematical calculations, data analysis, and scientific computing. It is designed to handle complex mathematical operations efficiently and provides a great environment for performing calculations, visualizing data, and developing algorithms. MATLAB is widely used in engineering, science, and economics for tasks like solving equations, analyzing data, and creating models.

MATLAB's primary strength lies in its ability to work with matrices and perform operations on them easily, making it the natural choice for computational mathematics. Additionally, it provides built-in graphics tools that make it easy to plot data and visualize mathematical functions, which are key for data analysis and research. The MATLAB desktop environment encourages users to experiment and explore different ideas and solutions.

MATLAB is also flexible in integrating with other programming languages like Java, C/C++, and .NET, allowing users to combine MATLAB's power with other languages for building applications and systems.

\subsection*{Key Features of MATLAB}

\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{MATLAB Window Components}
The main window in MATLAB is divided into several panels:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Current Folder:} This panel shows the directory where files are located. We can navigate through our computer's file system here.
	\item \textbf{Command Window:} This is the area where we type commands and execute them. The prompt $(>>)$ indicates that MATLAB is ready to accept a command.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth, height=0.4\textheight]{Images/4}
	\caption{Opening window in MATLAB}
	\label{fig:screenshot002}
\end{figure}
\subsection*{Basic MATLAB Commands}
There are several useful commands in MATLAB that help manage our workspace, run code, and get help:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \texttt{clc}: Clears the command window, removing previous outputs and messages.
	\item \texttt{clear}: Clears all variables from the workspace, freeing up memory.
	\item \texttt{close}: Closes any open figure or plot windows.
	\item \texttt{help}: Provides information about a specific MATLAB function. For example, typing \texttt{help sum} will give details on how to use the \texttt{sum} function.
	\item \texttt{doc}: Opens the full MATLAB documentation for a specific function. It gives detailed descriptions and examples.
	\item \texttt{pwd}: Displays the current working directory where MATLAB is looking for files.
	\item \texttt{cd}: Changes the current directory. For example, \texttt{cd('C:/Documents')} will change the directory to the specified folder.
	\item \texttt{save}: Saves the current variables in the workspace to a file for later use.
	\item \texttt{load}: Loads variables from a saved file into the workspace.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Workspace}
The \textbf{Workspace} is where all the variables we create and manipulate are stored. It acts as the memory for MATLAB, allowing us to keep track of our data, intermediate results, and final outputs. We can see a list of all variables in the workspace and manage them from the workspace panel.

MATLAB's environment is designed to be user-friendly, and it encourages users to experiment with different commands, functions, and scripts. Whether  solving math problems, visualizing data, or designing systems, MATLAB makes these tasks easier with its rich set of tools and features.


\subsection{Basic Matrix Manipulations}

In this section, we will cover various matrix manipulations in MATLAB, including creating matrices, performing arithmetic operations, and working with matrix dimensions.

\subsection*{Matrix of Zeros}
A matrix of zeros can be created using the \texttt{zeros} function. For example, to create a 3x3 matrix of zeros:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=vscode-light]
	A = zeros(3, 3);
\end{lstlisting}
The resulting matrix \( A \) will be:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
	0 & 0 & 0 \\
	0 & 0 & 0 \\
	0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\]

\subsection*{Matrix of Ones}
A matrix of ones can be created using the \texttt{ones} function. For example, to create a 3x2 matrix of ones:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=vscode-light]
	B = ones(3, 2);
\end{lstlisting}
The resulting matrix \( B \) will be:
\[
B = \begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 1 \\
	1 & 1 \\
	1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

\subsection*{Identity Matrix}
An identity matrix can be created using the \texttt{eye} function. For example, to create a 4x4 identity matrix:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=vscode-light]
	C = eye(4);
\end{lstlisting}
The resulting matrix \( C \) will be:
\[
C = \begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
	0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
	0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
	0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

\subsection*{Matrix of Random Numbers}
A matrix of random numbers can be created using the \texttt{rand} function. For example, to create a 4x2 matrix of random numbers:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=vscode-light]
	D = rand(4, 2);
\end{lstlisting}
The resulting matrix \( D \) might look like:
\[
D = \begin{bmatrix}
	0.4981 & 0.7386 \\
	0.9009 & 0.5860 \\
	0.5747 & 0.2467 \\
	0.8452 & 0.6664
\end{bmatrix}
\]

\subsection*{Size of a Matrix}
To find the size of a matrix, we use the \texttt{size} function. For example:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=vscode-light]
	size_B = size(B);
\end{lstlisting}
The result will be:
\[
\text{size\_B} = [3, 2]
\]
This indicates that matrix \( B \) has 3 rows and 2 columns.

\subsection*{Transpose of a Matrix}
The transpose of a matrix can be found using the \texttt{'} operator. For example:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=vscode-light]
	Trans = D';
\end{lstlisting}
The resulting matrix \( Trans \) will be:
\[
Trans = \begin{bmatrix}
	0.4981 & 0.9009 & 0.5747 & 0.8452 \\
	0.7386 & 0.5860 & 0.2467 & 0.6664
\end{bmatrix}
\]

\subsection*{Creating a Matrix}
Matrices can be created directly by specifying the elements. For example:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=vscode-light]
	b = [2 -4 5; 1 2 5; 5 0 1];
\end{lstlisting}
The resulting matrix \( b \) will be:
\[
b = \begin{bmatrix}
	2 & -4 & 5 \\
	1 & 2 & 5 \\
	5 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

\subsection*{Matrix Addition}
Matrices of the same size can be added element-wise. For example, if \( a \) and \( b \) are two matrices of the same size:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=vscode-light]
	sum = a + b;
\end{lstlisting}
The resulting matrix \( sum \) will be:
\[
sum = \begin{bmatrix}
	2.0835 & -3.2702 & 5.7690 \\
	1.6260 & 2.8908 & 5.5814 \\
	5.6609 & 0.9823 & 1.9283
\end{bmatrix}
\]

\subsection*{Matrix Subtraction}
Matrices of the same size can be subtracted element-wise. For example:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=vscode-light]
	sub = a - b;
\end{lstlisting}
The resulting matrix \( sub \) will be:
\[
sub = \begin{bmatrix}
	-1.9165 & 4.7298 & -4.2310 \\
	-0.3740 & -1.1092 & -4.4186 \\
	-4.3391 & 0.9823 & -0.0717
\end{bmatrix}
\]

\subsection*{Matrix Multiplication}
Matrix multiplication is performed using the \texttt{*} operator. For example:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=vscode-light]
	multi = a * b;
\end{lstlisting}
The resulting matrix \( multi \) will be:
\[
multi = \begin{bmatrix}
	4.7419 & 1.1256 & 4.8352 \\
	5.0499 & -0.7223 & 8.1650 \\
	6.9458 & -0.6792 & 9.1446
\end{bmatrix}
\]

\subsection*{Element-wise Multiplication}
Element-wise multiplication of matrices can be done using the \texttt{.*} operator. For example:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=vscode-light]
	emulti = a .* b;
\end{lstlisting}
The resulting matrix \( emulti \) will be:
\[
emulti = \begin{bmatrix}
	0.1670 & -2.9190 & 3.8451 \\
	0.6260 & 1.7815 & 2.9072
\end{bmatrix}
\]

\subsection{Calculating and Plotting the Fourier Series of a Square Wave}

\subsubsection*{Theory}
A Fourier series expresses a periodic function as a sum of sines and cosines. For a square wave, only sine terms with odd harmonics contribute. The Fourier series approximation is given by:
\[
f(t) = \frac{4}{\pi} \sum_{n=1,3,5,\dots}^{N} \frac{1}{n} \sin(2\pi fnt)
\]
where \( N \) represents the number of terms. Increasing \( N \) enhances the accuracy of the approximation, although discontinuities exhibit the Gibbs phenomenon.

\subsection{Matrix Manipulation: Calculating Average Test Marks}

\subsubsection*{Theory}
MATLAB excels at matrix operations, enabling efficient data processing. In this task, we store test marks in a matrix where each row corresponds to a student and each column to a test. The \texttt{mean} function is used to compute both the average per student (row-wise) and the overall average mark.

\begin{table}[H]

\subsection{User-Defined Functions in MATLAB}

\subsubsection*{Theory}
User-defined functions in MATLAB allow us to create reusable pieces of code. In this example, we define a function \texttt{celsiusToFahrenheit} that converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit, using user input. This modular approach allows the conversion logic to be reused easily in other parts of the program.

\subsubsection{MATLAB Code: Function File}
Save the following code in a file named \texttt{celsiusToFahrenheit.m}.
\begin{lstlisting}[style=vscode-light, caption={User-Defined Function: celsiusToFahrenheit.m}]
	function fahrenheit = celsiusToFahrenheit(celsius)
	% celsiusToFahrenheit converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
	% Input:
	%   celsius - temperature in Celsius
	% Output:
	%   fahrenheit - temperature in Fahrenheit
	
	fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32;
	end
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection*{MATLAB Code: Main Script Using the Function with User Input}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=vscode-light, caption={Using the User-Defined Function with User Input}]
	% Using the user-defined function to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit based on user input
	clear; clc;
	% Ask the user to input a temperature in Celsius
	celsius = input('Enter temperature in Celsius: ');
	% Call the function to convert to Fahrenheit
	fahrenheit = celsiusToFahrenheit(celsius);
	% Display the result
    disp(fahrenheit);
\end{lstlisting}
